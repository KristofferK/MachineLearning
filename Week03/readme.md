!Week 3

!!week03_exercise2_moon_clustering_using_kmeans.py
Exercise two. Here we use K-means to cluster our moons.

!!week03_exercise3_decision_tree_accuracy_and_draw.py
Exercise three. Here we use a decision tree and calculate the accuracy.

!!week03_exercise4_random_forest_accuracy_and_draw.py
Exercise four. Much like exercise three, except we use random forest instead of a single decision three.

!!week03_exercise5_decision_tree_accuracy_and_draw_on_circle.py
Exercise five. Instead of the somewhat simple moon dataset, we instead use a more complex circle dataset. Once again we use the decision tree.
